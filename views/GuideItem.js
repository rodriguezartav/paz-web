          Paz is located in a small gulf where it's hard to see someone walking down the beach. 
          \n\rRight in front of the house (50 steps) you'll find a little sandy inlet, under the shadow of palm trees that we outfitted with hammocs and comfy furniture where you'll want to spend day and night.\n\r
          
          Discover why it's a favorite among scarlet maccaws and the 4 species of monkeys. Catch a wave, go paddle boarding or take a dip in the pacific ocean's turquioise and emmerald waters.

        `Paz (peace) is the feeling I hope that you experience while being here. It's not the opposite of stress, it's the result of being aware to the mechanisms of stress
           and the mastery to overcome them at any time.\n\r
  
        It's the indescribable presence thatâ€™s felt when we are truly here. Instead of thinking about situations that are not here in front of us. \n\r
        
        Here in Paz, it's easy to find a spot where nothing 'human' is happending, nothing needs to be done, and yet everything happends wonderfully. We can just be present, drop the weight of our shoulders and let things happend.\n\r
        
           In this course we'll use nature and observation. Simple things like sitting on the beach, hicking on the jungle, watching a bonefire, looking at the sunset. To surface our behavior and become aware of our particular stress mechanics.\n\r
  
           We'll use you own insights and my diverse background in internal arts to find the mix of technics that work best for you. \n\r
           
           Our goal is to develop the awareness to observe our state of mind, uncover the source of it's conditining and discover the internal arts ( mind,heart,++ )

                  The Osa the Peninsula is the last frontier in Costa Rica. Unspolied and pristine it's considered the most biodiverse place on earth,
                  meaning it's packed densily with wildlife. The jaguar and 7 other species of felines lives here, tapir, ant eaters, sloths, the scarlet maccaw, 
                  humpback and shark whales, turtles, rays, the 4 species of monkeys, 900 types of huge trees and the most amazing insects yet to be discoved and named.\n\r
                  We are located on the tip of the peninsula in Cabo Matapalo, a 2 acre beach front property covered in forest. We are blessed with an area of primary forest, 
                  a cozy little white sand beach, a sand bottom creek, 4 swimming spots near by, a small bay to paddleboard with beginner and intermediate waves for surfing right in front.
