              There is a state of mind designed to be used to learn new things.
              It's an open state of mind, it's focused, and it's relaxed.
              Unfortunately, it's also scarce these days. It gets even more
              infrequent the older we get, and our concepts solidify.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              When we want to learn something new, we must bring that state of
              mind when we go to a class, a course, or a retreat. Don't go to
              see what it's like to check it out. With that attitude, you'll
              never be able to see what it's like.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              If we approach learning by comparing it with the old, by wanting
              to understand what it's all about. Imagine a kid in class, the
              first of math, frustrated with the teacher because he can't grasp
              what all this is about when the teacher says, "Let's start with 1.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              If we are to learn anything, we must start with 1. We must trust,
              listen and do what our teacher tells us to do. Then, focus and
              send away all distractions in body and mind by saying - no! go
              away, I am focused on doing that.

                Do it as if your life depended on it. In reality, it does. As if
                you are climbing a mountain and the rocks in the trail are
                loose, you have to be with each step. If a mosquito is flying
                about, you must let it fly because you have to focus on each
                step.

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              Do your best, all the way. Close any other channels of thought,
              the ones comparing, the ones judging, labeling, and especially
              those trying to understand. There will be time for that. In the
              end, you will understand - but you need to focus now on each
              instruction as if your life depends on it. Otherwise, your brain
              won't know that it's learning time.
