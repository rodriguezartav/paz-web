              Unfortunately, as adults, our attention becomes stuck in the one

              Every mind is unique, so for each person, there is a unique key to
              take attention away from the mind, and one could say that growth
              is about finding and learning to use that key.

              The unique combination of movements creates a feeling that, when
              followed, frees our attention from being locked in the mind.

              This is very simple, but our mind-training makes it seem hard. We
              must concentrate and tell apart imagination from actual fact. We

              <span className="text-indigo-600 text-2xl">

              It's something else. Attention or awareness is way above that in
              terms of the hierarchy of consciousness. It's what notices the
              seeing and the thinking. It's what allows it to happen. So let's
              do a short exercise to realize that:

              We are not particles that make up the body. We are not the body.

                We are not the mind.
              </span>{" "}
              We are not the heart and not even the energy field surrounding it.
              We are much more than that, So it could be said,{" "}
              <span className="text-indigo-600 text-2xl">
                we are what's aware of all that.

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              Follow awareness to the most subtle and delicate part. As close as
              possible to where it all starts. Notice you exist and move back.
              Notice what you are aware of and make it wide, make it wide, and
              <span className="text-indigo-600 text-2xl">
                {" "}
                then make it even wider until you are aware of everything you
                can.

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              Somewhere down the line, you'll find what you believed was you;
              thoughts, feelings, everything there is inside. But since you are
              aware of that, that can't be you. You are more than that.

              <span className="text-indigo-600 text-2xl">
                Become fully aware that you are aware,
              </span>{" "}
              be brave and stay still. Enjoy the split second where home and you
              become one.
