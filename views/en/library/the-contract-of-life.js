              There is nothing we can acquire to solve our vulnerability as
              living beings. No weapon, no wall, no insurance, no amount of
              money, no medicine, no prayer, no knowledge, nothing. In the same
              way, there is nothing we can invent, build or create to solve our
              collective problems because those problems are produced by our
              attempt to be less vulnerable.

              If we are serious about finding out the truth of who we are and
              what life is. Then we must begin by considering our most cherished
              attachments with other things and beings. Our loved ones,
              livelihoods, careers, everything we own, health, businesses,
              projects, and dreams.

              So one of the things I tried to overcome the feelings inside was
              Ayahuasca, which did wonders for me on many levels. "The plant"
              was extra generous by helping me see many facts about my life and
              myself that I could not see. But my mind is so stubborn and
              ego-centric that it swapped some it's my beliefs, moving from a
              science-mind-centric approach into a magic-spirit-centric one.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              What did not change and became a severe condition that made me
              suffer tremendously was a background reality where I was petrified
              of something else happening to me or my loved ones. Unfortunately,
              I overlooked this reality since it was not on the surface of my
              day to day, but it did show up in significant moments of my life.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              As a response, my mind was trying to reach an agreement with any
              form of God that would "sign it" where nothing terrible was going
              to happen again, and I would not feel so bad inside. So it swapped
              the old beliefs of getting security from society and medicine,
              that is, working hard, following the law, insurance, and so on.
              But in the background, everything remained the same.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              The back and forth between trying to get security from spirit in
              the form of energy and light against the dark and getting it from
              society in the form of money, power, and recognition must be
              expected until the need for security is gone. Finding that within
              ourselves is such an accomplishment for any human!
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              Some call this background the unconscious, the ego, the self, and
              no matter its name - it's out of reach to any external element
              because it exists before the devices that are mindful of the
              exterior.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              It's actually out of reach from our own minds. So if we want to
              tap into that, motivated by a desire to heal, we must find our
              true self beyond the mind, which is the only one that can be aware
              of that.
            </p>

                <br />I may meditate for the rest of my life, and I may be
                deceiving myself. I may be living in a vast series of illusions,
                thinking those are real. So I must understand myself.
