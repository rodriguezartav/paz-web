              Awareness is the key to the mind, but it's just a word here. We
              need to find the key, not the word or its meaning. To open the

              . What we understood about enlightenment, karma, science,

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              Letting these beliefs affect our exploration of consciousness it's
              like watching a movie and thinking that's how our love story will
              play out. As with any explorer worth its salt: Just make sure you

              Well, if we are conscious beings, yes, of course, we can. That's

              Anything related to consciousness and meditation it's like

              <span className="text-indigo-600 text-2xl">
                You can not learn to dance by understanding how to dance.

              You can't move your feet by thinking about how to move your feet.
              You have to move them, but most importantly:{" "}
              <span className="text-indigo-600 text-2xl">
                dancing is only enjoyed when there is no mind.

              Dancing is fun when we become the dance.

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              So it's like dancing. If you think about it, then you ruin it. If
              you try to learn by thinking about it, you'll never find out what
              it's like.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              Consciousness and awareness just are, and we'll never know what
              they are.
              <span className="text-indigo-600 text-2xl">
                We just know that we are.
              </span>{" "}
              So let's dance in the realm of consciousness and awareness into
              another dimension of existence.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              If you need something to hold on to, remember that we think we are
              made of particles. Then think about Heisenberg's Uncertainty
              Principle, where a particle's position and "movement" can't be
              known simultaneously. For example, in 1970, an experiment revealed
              all matter is a wave and a particle at the same time.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              That's us. Recall we think we are made of particles. Inherently,
              we can be two things at the same time. We can be a person and a
              wave at the same time. We can be individuals, and we can be one
              simultaneously. Don't think the owner of the eyes will ever
              understand, just know that's were we stand.

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              Humans are not meant to notice all that. Hence, the web of
              mind-reality protects us from getting confused; we are meant to
              focus and survive, but we are curious cats.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              We already know that things are not as they seem under the hood of
              matter. We know we are something, but we don't know what we are.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              We can not understand and be at the same time. So now that we are
              about to look under the hood of consciousness - we can expect the
              same. Just forget about thinking, and remember to dance.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-coolGray-500">
              As a pirate, now is when I would write on the map: You still have
              time to turn back.
