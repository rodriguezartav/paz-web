        `         Our 2 acre property is located on one of the last patches of
                  primary rainforest on the beach. Everyone, specially animals
                  love it here. Many species of animals live here.\n\rWe are
                  constantly visited by the four species of monkeys, scarlet
                  maccaws, toucans, pavones, pizontes, ant eaters, the Tapir and
                  wild hogs have visited here. Tracks and sightings of felines
                  are possible. You can see the whales from the beach, swim with
                  turtles.

        `Part of it is because of our scientific arm with the Saimiri
                  Non-Profit organization. Most people think about tress in
                  terms of size, but whats important is the food they provide.
                  So we know what food, trees and plants to preserve for the
                  whole food chain.

                  Instead of having the house right on the beach, we gave 150
                  feet of space protecting a beautifll patch of primary forest
                  with ancient gigantic trees. It's an amazing ecosystem full of
                  the stangest insects, butterflies, beautifill birds and the
                  coolest birds of pray. A beachfront primary forest is very
                  rare this days and it's worth preserving.

                  Discover wellness is the traditional costarrican way - it's
                  called Pura Vida and it represents the way we use natural
                  beauty. Leave your troubles behind, find a magical spot, and
                  have a great time.

                The Osa the Peninsula is the last frontier in Costa Rica. Unspolied and pristine it's considered the most biodiverse place on earth,
                meaning it's packed densily with wildlife. The jaguar and 7 other species of felines lives here, tapir, ant eaters, sloths, the scarlet maccaw, 
                humpback and shark whales, turtles, rays, the 4 species of monkeys, 900 types of huge trees and the most amazing insects yet to be discoved and named.\n\r
                We are located on the tip of the peninsula in Cabo Matapalo, a 2 acre beach front property covered in forest. We are blessed with an area of primary forest, 
                a cozy little white sand beach, a sand bottom creek, 4 swimming spots near by, a small bay to paddleboard with beginner and intermediate waves for surfing right in front.
