        `         Our 2 acre property is located on one of the last patches of
                  primary rainforest on the beach. Everyone, specially animals
                  love it here. Many species of animals live here.\n\rWe are
                  constantly visited by the four species of monkeys, scarlet
                  maccaws, toucans, pavones, pizontes, ant eaters, the Tapir and
                  wild hogs have visited here. Tracks and sightings of felines
                  are possible. You can see the whales from the beach, swim with
                  turtles.\n\rDiscover wellness is the traditional costarrican way - it's
                  called Pura Vida and it represents the way we use natural
                  beauty. Leave your troubles behind, find a magical spot, and
                  have a great time.\n\rThe root of our disconection is the speed we run our lives. So
                  calm down, be silent, stay still, put down the heavy weight of
                  thought as to slow down enought to re-join the flow of nature.
                  You'll know you made it when you hear the song of the forest...

                The Osa the Peninsula is the last frontier in Costa Rica. Unspolied and pristine it's considered the most biodiverse place on earth,
                meaning it's packed densily with wildlife. The jaguar and 7 other species of felines lives here, tapir, ant eaters, sloths, the scarlet maccaw, 
                humpback and shark whales, turtles, rays, the 4 species of monkeys, 900 types of huge trees and the most amazing insects yet to be discoved and named.\n\r
                We are located on the tip of the peninsula in Cabo Matapalo, a 2 acre beach front property covered in forest. We are blessed with an area of primary forest, 
                a cozy little white sand beach, a sand bottom creek, 4 swimming spots near by, a small bay to paddleboard with beginner and intermediate waves for surfing right in front.

                  Activities are included, and there are over 45 of them to
                  choose from. Some are in the property and some require hiking.
                  Some require equipment, like paddle boards and kayaking. The
                  solo-bonefire under the stars is a favorite!

        `The beach lounge is the retreat's main attraction and activity. Is where everyone wants to spend their days and nights. It's where the best work is done.
         And it's where nothing has to be done.\n\rThe lounge is located in a private & cozy sandy beach under palm trees, 3 steps above the pacific ocean's turquioise and emmerald water. 
         It's typically visited by Scarlet Maccaws, Monkeys and all sort of birds. 50 feet away from the house and next to a primary forest with huge trees. On a pristine beach, where hardly anyone walks by.`,
