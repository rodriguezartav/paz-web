## Welcome to The Osa Peninsula

I discovered the Osa Peninsula when I was a young backpacker and surfer. I quickly fell in love, and at some point the magic got inside my heart, I sold everythig I owned, bought a motorcycle and a camping tent and landed in Mata Palo. I have never left.

This is a very special place that hasn't been spoiled, it's a unique oportunity to connect with nature in a very profound way.

The guide represents my personal recomendations, I try to be fair but I do favor guides and business that are integrated with the community.
