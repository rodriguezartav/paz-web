## Yes
The Osa Peninsula is such an important experience for kids. Kids are open so they can experience everything first hand, there is nowhere in the world that they can get so close and connected with nature.

For us adults, we need to see the Jaguar or a the Tapir or the Scarley Maccaws. But kids can look and amaze themselfs by the simplest animal and intuitively understand that they are and essecial part of it all. They can spend hours looking at ants, or kermit crabs. It's just amazing to see their eyes light up and then to hear the expresion of their perception in their unique way.

## Experience with our son
My son was born here, and he is still alive! We travel a lot and other than the typical flu's and getting stiches from falling from the bed at night there is nothing particulary different from being anywhere else in the world other than being mindful of sunburns even if it's cloudy. There is a 24 hour clinic in town, private doctors  and pharmacy ( check the services page ). 

Most importantly with kids is not to worry to much about activities, bring here is an activity for them. The ocean is warm all year round, you can go outside and even swin even if it's raining. Being in the jungle is a sensorial activity for the young ones, and also a great opportunity to spend time in family with out having to do something. Find places where you can hang out.


## Activities for Kids

Other than the full day hikes to Corcovado National Park all activities in the Osa Peninsula are kid friendly. Remember this is an off-the-beaten path destination where most people you'll encounter are owner or very close to the owners. We live her, we all have kids.

I took my son camping to Mata Palo when he was 4 months old. We went horseback riding when he was 1. Surfing with me at 1 year (  surf lessons are for 8 years an up and so is Zip Lining.

Honestly there is only 1 Zip Line and it's not open every day, other than that there are no typical comecial activities.

### Hiking
When it's time to do something or go crazy... Then look for hikes, beach walks and such and try to explore. You don't have to have guide a, simply observe nature togheter. It's the most biodiverse place on the world, it's full of things to watch.

### Water Park
There is a small water park in town open on weekends.

### Surfing
For kids, I only recommend surf Lessons with Pollo Surf School. 8 year olds and up (  maybe 7 it depends on the kid).

### Dolfine watching and snorkeling
Take a boat from Puerto Jimenez or Golfito, the rest is history!

### Kayak
Got to Playa Blanca in La Palma and rent a kayak. Got to your left and enter the mangroves. You can also do it in Puerto Jimenez by renting a Kayak.

### Pools
- Mar Luna very close to Paz in Sombrero
- Encanta La Vida in Mata Palo
- Las Palmeras in Playa Preciosa

## Beaches for Kids
There are an infinite amount of beaches with no one around, most of them form nice tide pools in low tide.

### Playa Blanca in La Palma
Very calm beach with no waves. Inside the gulf, the bottom may not be as sandy.

Great for older kids that want to play in the shore break at mid tide.
