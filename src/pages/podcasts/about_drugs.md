## The intersection between drugs and spirituality

{% podcast url="https://www.buzzsprout.com/2031327/11097332-the-intersection-between-drugs-and-spirituality.js" /%}

Today. I like to talk about drugs, but not in the traditional way of looking at a person that consumes drugs or talking about yourself, consuming drugs, but rather as drugs as part of the reality of humanity and where do they fit from the beginning of time until now, but more importantly, why, what is the reason for them. If there is any

first of all, before we can talk about a right or proper or beneficial, or saying they're good or they're bad, but talking in a way for them to open something, we need to talk about the reason or the cause for them to deviate people into most of the things that we see about drugs.

So us humans, because of the way we have grown up and the way our education is and the way our society works, if we don't really look at it with a clear perspective, we simply go behind the other person in the line. Just following what the rest of the people are doing and trying to solve our problems under those set of rules.

And we don't really, go up the mountain and try to see with a larger perspective, a bigger per perspective what's going on we wouldn't be able to see the most important parts of it.

And we won't be able to see either why or where do negative effects of drugs and alcohol and even thoughts and the emotional causes

Most people don't realize and don't have to deal with them. Lately, there's been many more people that we have been forced to deal with those things with situations that happen to us, to our family, to our loved ones, there's many things that can happen to us that can, take us instantly to the top of the mountain and take a look at life.

everything from a very different perspective that the ones that we've been told since we are a kid of what is life and what's the value of life and what is our value in the world towards life. Because this, these things that can happen to us, it can be an accident. It can be even a lot of success that still doesn't make you feel whole doesn't make you feel complete. doesn't make you feel. , you know, so all these things and accidents or sickness and disease and all these things, not saying at all that they are the purpose, eh, for this, but they simply elevate us to a different perspective where, you know, the basic rules of society and, and life and work and commerce and all that. They really, they don't mean a thing anymore. They don't matter, especially at those moments. Then some things happen inside of you emotionally, you know, like the balance is no longer. right. And you don't feel yourself anymore, you're very sensible or there's a lot of thoughts in your head that you don't have a lot of questions a lot of doubts, you simply cannot live in the. As you used to be able to live.

You don't fit in there anymore. So at any of those stages even before, during or after any of those things happening to you or to the persons you're around things that have happened to your family, all these, adds up and then.

When we use drugs or when we use alcohol, even caffeine, it makes us feel better, right? It takes us out of these situations. If there is nothing to take us out of if our life is pretty stable and, we have our jobs and we have our work and we have our family, our relationship, our friends.

Having fun. Everything is alright. There's balance and good family, there shouldn't be a reason for, escape, but if there is one and then when we engage with any substance that can, that has the ability of taking us out, taking our mind not us, but taking our mind.

Off of that situation of that problem, of that call it vibration. If you have experienced this, and you have actually observe the change, before you have two or three beers and after.

There is a big change and people like it when they don't think about it they just enjoy the different state of mind. But in reality, there's many things happening right there. There's a big vibrational change, but it's not done by yourself alone. It's done true a substance.

So we, we give the value or the reason of that change to the substance. But in reality, what change. Was actually our state of mind. And we definitely have control over that without any substance, but that's a different topic, but the most important thing here for what we're talking today is that then if there is the necessity for escape, and the larger, the necessity, the bigger the influence you're gonna have or the less free you're gonna be from this substance, the more you're gonna need the substance.

And that's how addictions form. And that's how all these things, come into effect very negatively. But that's not the reason why drugs exist. That's not the reason why people came up with them or discovered them, or they came to the existence of humanity or to the knowledge of humanity

there is a right time. Or a right use for all of these things. But the problem with this is that if we go into them without being at that right time, being in that search, being that need, we go into them for fun, for experimentation, just because other people are doing it. And they're saying nice things about it.

What I'm talking about drugs. Don't only think about cocaine, right? It can be, it can even be legal drugs, it can even be all these painkillers, and antidepressants and antics. It could be the medicinal plants that are using in sacred ceremonies, like AKA , healing, mushrooms, and all that.

I'm talking about the whole spectrum. Of substances that we take.

The thing is that all of these things changes us deeply, very deeply. It's not just about having fun. You take it once and then that's it because what you experience at the moment, this new state of mind and once you experience life, in these different vibrational existence, then a bunch of questions come up. In reality, the deeper drug and the pure, the more pure it. the bigger, the change that you can have from, what you can experience.

The more you experience things, then the more we can move into or out of this very safe and comfortable place that is made out of two things. The first thing that this safe and comfortable place is made of out of is us.

You know what I called? When I say, I want, I am. I feel, I think all that the "I" is very comfortable. It's a very, it's a very safe and an individual place. It's me, I'm here. so that sense of being me, being myself that healthy sense in a way. that's one thing.

The other thing that gives us safety and comfort and all that is the support team the support team is the family and the jobs and the education and the knowledge. That we know that the tide goes up and gotten down and the moon rotates and the world is round and it goes around the sun and all our knowledge, all our conceptual building of the universe and every single thing around us, we knowing how things work, gives us that sense of safety.

So there's two things that give us a very pleasant experience of life in the world. One it's the knowledge. Of our existence of ourself and more, more important to keep them the knowledge the feeling that I am, and knowing that I am what I am and knowing that I am in balance, that is even a higher state of, healthiness or, you know, wellbeing.

And then knowing that I am and knowing that the things that are around me are also stable and in order and in place and working properly well, just saying it gives a sense of peace, I guess that is what we can call peace. So those two things working together. So the problem is or the most important thing is that none of that is real.

The human world society and all the constructions above it doesn't really exist. They're just an agreement between all of us, like the laws and economy and money and everything.

They are just, things that we created on top of nature on top of our lives. So those things don't really exist. And the more we go into the things that don't exist. And we go into the things that actually exist, in the universe in life and how the universe works.

Our scientific knowledge about the universe and about energy and matter. And the atom, they don't teach us that in high school, they don't teach us that in school. They don't even teach us that in the first years of university, because the deeper you go into reality, you start losing your sense, this sense of safety of I am. And you are, or we. So we lose that and

And in a way, the reason why all these things exist, these substances, these drugs are to allow us to see this deeper existence of life. But , they are not meant to be used the way that they are being used in, in modern times. This way of explaining it is the summary of many legends from a ancestral cultures. And in these cultures,, the people that knew how to use the natural medicines from the earth, you know, the natural substances that change our state of mind, they didn't use it. Without guidance, without knowledge, without wisdom, there was a person, there was a group of persons in charge of exploring and understanding, and that they dedicated their lives for many generations to be understanding on how these things are used for this specific purpose. So now that we have lost all that, we have lost all that knowledge and.

In a way we just came and say, we don't care about that. I'm just gonna do this and have a lot of fun. And it doesn't matter . Then that's how we end up in the situation that we are in right now.

Drugs. It's something that already exists, and it's something that I am observing and I am looking at, and with my experience, trying to give, that greatest perspective that I can give about it.

It's not that I am inventing them or I am telling people to use them. That's not what I'm doing. I'm they are already. Around us, everybody, especially the young people. So I guess it's very important that we talk about it, especially in this sense, because nowadays I see a lot of young people experimenting, and playing around and, enjoying themselves and entertaining themselves with all these very strong and very powerful drugs.

I'm talking about acid, I'm talking about even AKA mushrooms and. I guess cocaine in a way being more party, in the more party line or the MDMAs and all the other synthetic hallucinogenic drugs.

But in the end it's essential that we understand that, these are no things that you play with, but when you say.

We should at least say why, you know, someone that knows why should come up and say why these are things you should not play with, or at least say, not play with, unless you really want this to happen. And this is what happens. And it can be interpreted in several ways and most of the bad effects and most of the very bad.

First of all that hap happened because we are using the Maan escape from our reality, from our vibrational state.

First of all, we are using them as an escape. From our reality.

That reality we created. It ourselves with our thoughts. If our thoughts are very negative, always complaining, or we full of worries. Always full of. Negativity. Then that's gonna impregnate in our whole body in our whole reality i mean even in the way our mind works

so when we use drugs and we mix them with that and we use them to escape this situation, because we don't know how to do it without them.

We have this pain where we have this, sensation of sadness or. Ness or of, most people know what I mean. And you do a little marijuana, you do a little, a couple of beers, stronger alcohol, a couple of tequilas, go out, dancing, go out party, eh, or even, more stronger drugs in clubs and techno and all that.

And RAs, you start doing hallucinogenic mushrooms, acids. I don't have that. I don't have experience with all of these drugs. They will definitely take you away. I do have experience with, using substances to take me away. And everybody does have experience with this, using substances to, to get away from the situation that we are living right now.

So when you mix these two things, trying to get away and, drugs, the results can be interpreted in a very confusing way. I'm sure. Just by listening to this, you can understand the confusion because you are here now, you take the drug, now you're here.

Then the drug is the one that is doing this. And I just don't wanna be, or I wanna be the least amount of time on this, on this state where I don't feel well or my thoughts are negative, and nobody likes me. The things that I say, people don't understand to write on feed, and now I use drugs and everybody laughs at my jokes and all that, there, there's a confusion of who are you in the end there?

And then the stronger the drug, if you go into acid or mushrooms or ACAN and all that things can get a lot more confusing,

all these things somehow. I don't know how I actually, nobody knows how, and they don't even know how the medicines that we take to handle, the legal medicine or the psychiatric medicines. They don't know how they work because we don't know how the brain works. Scientifically speaking on medically speaking, there is the understanding for how antidepressants work is not complete at.

Much less for antics. Antics are very old. They're anesthetics from the seventies. They're super old and they're still, and they're still widely in news and there's no understanding of how they work. So there's no understanding even that, which is, medically approved and used. There is much less understanding of how, the. Kind of drugs that work at the same level in the brain. The way the other ones the natural ones, the more natural ones, they are a way that have been used for thousands of years to uncover the true existence of who we are. . So when we uncover the true existence of who we are, I guess logically, then we are no longer gonna be what we think we are.

And going back to what I was talking before, that sense of me and that sense of us, that sense of we, that sense of society, that sense of balance, all that has to go. You know, it's for that. It's to take all that away. It's not to take the pain away. It's not to take that numbness away. It's not to take away the things that we don't like.

There are much easier and simpler and effective ways to deal with all that, that, but drugs are not for that drugs are to take everything away, there are many other ways to take that away also, which are much more safer and much, much less unpleasant because drugs are super unpleasant at this level I'm talking about.

And at this doses and in this kind of ceremonies and in this kind of usage is super dangerous. It's not pleasant at all. And the result it's terrible, it's losing your sense of. Eh not on purpose. So when we young people, we start using drugs and we start playing around with all these, maybe just, or the microdosing, a little bit of this and a little bit of that.

That, that can have several effects depending on the person, depending on the background of the person, the emotional state and bunch of things. We're talking about high doses and we're talking about. I guess like the, if we can translate it to allopathic medicine, like the medicinal dose for all these drugs, the result is not a moment of escape.

It's escape forever and it's escaped from the nice things in the world and to get them back, it takes. The biggest effort that you can imagine to go back to that, to go back to enjoying the simple things in life, to be able to be present, to be able to feel yourself because you have to rediscover yourself once, once you touch that, once you see that, it's not like marijuana that you take a, you.

I joined and have a little, and then feel a little DC and, feel different state of mind and play a little, with that state of mind so that you stay in balance and that's, that's how you learn a little bit. It's like a training. It's a very small and very basic training on how to keep your mind, in balance.

But the other ones, the more stronger ones they can rip you apart. From that sense of self, they can rip you apart from all that. And if that's not what you're into and if that's not what you want, it's, it will have terrible effects because you would have been robbed from your identity.

You would have been robbed from all your sense of self. And then you'll be saying a lot I don't feel like myself. And, not on purpose because actually in meditation, in the path of yoga, in the path of self discovery, in the path of healing, actually, this is a very gradual thing that you go step by, step into it.

And then when you say, I don't feel myself anymore, it's actually a good thing. It's exactly what you want. Nonetheless, you feel like you. That is exactly where you wanna go. That's what you want. And that's the path to happiness the understanding of that and the discovering of where you do that from and, the feeling of that can happen instantly.

But the process of actually, getting there, it takes it's gradual, it takes time, it takes patience. Somehow there's no words for it, but somehow it's guided by, by something bigger than us, that it's also very gentle and very loving, and it won't let you, move past the things that you cannot handle somehow.

There's a way for that already established and it's not by humans. There's a way for trees to grow. There's a way for us humans to. Inside out of us, out of our humanity. But if, and that's what drugs are for to accelerate that in a way that, that's what they do.

And, but they are, they have been discovered and they have been used in different traditions in a very respectful and ceremonial way. And only in the required cases, only when it's needed. To break through something that the person cannot break through at that moment, and it's always guided and medicated by a professional, not the kind of professionals that we know in medicine, but professionals, people with a lot of experience in this with generations upon generations, that's.

Shamans and all these healing people, they're chosen up when they're very young and they start learning from the, when they're very young from the person that is training them. It's an apprenticeship, it's not written knowledge, it's oral knowledge and it's a different kind of transfer of knowledge.

And so when we go out and, and we go and. Acid or buy, AAS or, do AAS in a commercial setting or go do a lot of mushrooms. I'm not talking about, taking eating wine or a little bit here, a little bit there, or, smoking a little bit of marijuana, all that.

That can have negative effects for sure. But it's very hard that will have the kind of effects that I'm talking about. But, if you start doing it on your own and you start going chasing, chasing that, that escape and chasing those feelings of high, or even chasing this exploration on your own doing it, stupidly basically you're gonna hit that wall for sure.

And that. It's and if that's not what you want, then the next morning when you wake up and you won't find yourself there anymore, it will be very confusing because you will not have the tools. You will not have the backup and the experience and the knowledge and the people around you, and the due process for you to be at that stage.

For all the people that are. Raising drugs and even the natural ones for, to treat, mental health problems. We need to understand that. Or, I don't know if understand, but this is not about, taking away. That's not what they do. They don't take away the bad parts.

They don't take away the pain. They don't take away the suffering. That's a lie. That's a hundred percent a lie. , that's not what drugs are for. Drugs are not made to make you feel better. None, not even the medicinal ones. That's not how you get cured. They're implement to hide the pain so that you can get better yourself.

But if you're not doing either of those, to make the pain a little bit less or make the effects or the symptoms a little bit less so that your body has the time to heal. you have the time to heal yourself, but it's not it's is, that's not what we're doing. We are avoiding the real situation and we are using them as an escape.

Then it's not that it's bad. It's not that, it's an ethical or legal that's too little that's that has no meaning at all. No importance. That doesn't matter. What matters is that, the things that you're playing with. The most important things in the universe, in the existence of what gives life to you, right now not in that.

You are not in a book. No, right now what life means to you right now and how you identify with it, how you see yourself in it, what's your position in life. And if that, and being wrapped up that by a drug, you. By a bad advice. It's, it's the worst thing that can happen to someone.

Honestly, it's the worst thing that can happen to a human being, being dropped of life while still being alive. It's the worst thing that can happen. And that's what we are playing with when we talk about drugs, that's the level at which they work.

So that's it for today. Hopefully. I was able to share. All of my knowledge. I know from my experience. Learning from other people as well, listening and absorbing them. I'm scaring myself. And most importantly, trying to reach a connection between. Drugs and spirituality. Because they actually are part of the same thing.

And if we really understood that. If we really learn from that. And leasing to the people that. Understand. Their relationships, their intersections. Then.

At least they would not harm us as much as they do.

Because by the time that they damage us, that they harm us. From our own.

We're on usage. Then it's too late. And it takes a lifetime to recover from that. It is.
