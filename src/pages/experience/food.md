## A house worthy of its location

The house is 50 steps from the sand and surrounded by large primary forest trees. Monkeys, Scalet Maccaws, Morpho Butherflies and even the Tapir swing by every day. It took me than 5+ years to get the design right.

### The Paz Concept

This house is more than a place to stay, as Paz is much more than a tourism business. My purpose is to offer a space where people can experience, feel, the magic of nature. The main house is the center of this experience since it's where we'll be spending the greatest amount of time.

Typical architects care about luxury and other aspects of design. We value comfort in terms of feeling fresh, dry and protected in a place where we want to stay. Most importantly we care about maintaining an unbroken connection with the natural environment during every moment your trip. That gives a feeling that's only matched by camping.

### Remote and Off the grid

Paz is 100% off-grid, we produce our own electircity and extract water straight from mother earth. Everything from design, to installation and maintance of every building, equipment and decoration was hand-made by us.

We get our energy from the sun and water from the earth underneeth. It's so much more than cool because it defines the space around us, which end up defining ourselfs.
