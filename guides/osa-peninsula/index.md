The Osa the Peninsula is the last frontier in Costa Rica. Unspolied and pristine it's considered the most biodiverse place on earth,
meaning it's packed densily with wildlife. The jaguar and 7 other species of felines lives here, tapir, ant eaters, sloths, the scarlet maccaw,
humpback and shark whales, turtles, rays, the 4 species of monkeys, 900 types of huge trees and the most amazing insects yet to be discoved and named.\n\r
We are located on the tip of the peninsula in Cabo Matapalo, a 2 acre beach front property covered in forest. We are blessed with an area of primary forest,
a cozy little white sand beach, a sand bottom creek, 4 swimming spots near by, a small bay to paddleboard with beginner and intermediate waves for surfing right in front.

## Welcome to The Osa Peninsula

I discovered the Osa Peninsula when I was a young backpacker and surfer. I quickly fell in love, and at some point the magic got inside my heart, I sold everythig I owned, bought a motorcycle and a camping tent and landed in Mata Palo. I have never left.

This is a very special place that hasn't been spoiled, it's a unique oportunity to connect with nature in a very profound way.
