## An overview by activity

Every activity has the best moment, most of then can be enjoyed year round.

### Surfing

The High performance surfing season is from March to August. February and September/October are wildcards. For the rest of surfers the season is from February into November.

### Hiking and Wildlife

The only month that is not recomended is October, other than that you are good.

### Relaxing

Year round, you'll find that the more it rains the more alive, mystical and magical this place becomes.

### Family trips

Make sure you don't come in the middle of a tropical storm and you are good. ( check National Hurracain Center )

### Whale watching

We see the first whales at the beggining of July all the way into December, sitting in a chair in the beach. Or take a deep dive and stay still and listen to their songs. You can also take a tour and look at them up close.

## Calendar

### January

The second nicest month in Costa Rica. Very sunny and not hot at all. Great for swimming as there are almost no waves. Nature is confortable, good balance between moisuture and sun light. Tree start to prepare for a time with less rain.

### February

In February temperatures raise a bit and there is more chance of rain, but other than that is exactly as January. The first waves start to show up, but typically there are no waves. Nature is confortable as well.

### March

This is a warm month and may be the driest of them all. It's more dusty and can go days without a drop of rain. A great

### April

The first rains arrive in April and it makes every living being super happpy. Temperatures peak.

### May

Typical daily patters of sunlinght in the morning and rain in the afternoon.

### June

Typical daily patters of sunlinght in the morning and rain in the afternoon.

### July

Typical daily patters of sunlinght in the morning and rain in the afternoon.

### August

This is a hidden gem, since most people consider it rainy season. It's actually my favorite month. It does not rain as much as in July, there are great waves, the forest is full of food and the animals move a lot.

### September

### October

We can have several straight days of rain, we typically travel during this month as it's super low season. But the years we do stay, it's actually a great time with no one around and good waves. Plenty of food in the forest, and if it rains for serveral days then the animals really all come out at once.

### November

May be very similar to October. At this stage the tropical waves that come from Africa call the shots. If there are not waves passing by it should be sunny and very pleasant weather. Fewer waves and very little people.

### December

Primetime. Probably the nicest month in Costa Rica. Some storms might still show up during the first days of December even if the hurracaine season it's officially over. Very sunny and not hot at all. Perfect weather, happy people.
