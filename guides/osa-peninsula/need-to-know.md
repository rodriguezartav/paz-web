## Getting here and away

There are 4 ways to reach the Osa Peninsula and I'll cover the pros and cons of each.

### Bus

There are daily buses from San Jose and Perez Zeledon to Puerto Jimenez and Golfito. You can get from the Panama border to Golfito by bus, but it's better to get a taxi "colectivo" ( ask around ).

### Car

The Osa Peninsula can be reached by all kinds of cars from the Interamerican Highway. From the entrance in Chacarita Gas Station it takes 1 hour to reach Puerto Jimenez and 1.5 hours to reach Mata Palo and Drake Bay.

The road to Drake Bay, Mata Palo and Carate ( Corcovado National Park ) is gravel and all creeks/rivers now have bridges. The gravel roads / bridges are sensitive to heavy rains that can enter from the sea any time of the year. A large/stronger car is recomended for this road but it does not need to have 4-wheel-drive.

### Plane

[Sansa](http://flysansa.com) flies to Puerto Jimenez, Golfito and Drake Bay from the SJO regional terminal ( 5 minute walk from the international terminal). Sansa is a regional airline and it's got a great safety record. It used to be owned by Avianca.

In Puerto Jimenez you can rent a car in the reginal Alamo Rent a Car. Keep in mind they only have a few cars. For most trips between December to August a two-wheel-drive medium-size-car works perfectly. You probably won't need 4x4.

### Boat

This options may work for light packed travelers. There are 5 daily boats between Golfito to Puerto Jimenez. There is also daily boat service between Sierpe and Drake Bay. All other boat trips are chartered or part of a tour, including those going to Corcovado National Park and Pavones.

Check the recomendations in the services page if you want to rent a charter boat from Puerto Jimenez/Mata Palo to Pavones.

## Getting around

In Puerto Jimenez there are plenty of taxi's to drive your around. Take a look on the services section on the menu to left on desktop, towards the end in mobile for our recomendations. Other wise there is a chicken bus from Puerto Jimenez to Carate twice a day.

There are daily buses from Puerto Jimenez to La Palma, but they don't connect with the boats schedules. From La Palma you can catch the colectivo to Drake Bay. Check on the services page for contact info or inquire in Osa Wild Tour Operator.

In Golfito there colectivo taxis that can take you anywhere, even the Panama border and probably to Pavones if you are lucky. There are daily buses to Pavones and Zancudo.

## When to come

For some strange reason people think the rain is a problem when visiting the tropical rain forest...

The wonders of the Osa Peninsula are available year round, but can be better experienced when it's raining regularly. Wildlife experiences increase proportinaly with rain.

In Costa Rica there is no specific rainy season. It rains all the time but there are two types of rain. Check the month-by-month page for more detailed information.

### Normal Rain

From May to December a typical costarrican won't complain if the sun shines in the morning and it rains in the afternoon/night. From December to March it rains less. The only season that is truly wonderfull is December and January, the rest of the year is all the same.

### To much rain

Tropical storms from Africa cross the Caribeean and move west-north-west. Some of them turn in hurracains, which don't tyically hit directly Costa Rica directly. Storm influence may bring to the Osa Peninsula the biggest amount of rain you have ever seen in your life. It's actually something worth experiencing.

Things turn get quite boring when we get a run of storms one after the other, there is a large probability for this to happend during September and October. Still, without any storms it's sunny in the morning and dark in the afternoon.

### Staying Safe

The Osa Peninsula like most places in the world. It's better to be safe than sorry.

For such being the most biodiverse place on earth it's surprising there are not that many threats. There is no Malaria, spiders and not dangerous, scorpions sting a bit but that's it. This is not common for national parks and protected remote areas.

The greatest threat to your life is the Ferdilance Snake, there are plenty here. But don't worry they don't chase and eat humans. They just get angry when we step on them. So try not to step on them by following the two golden rules.

- Always be aware where you step when in nature
- Always use a flashlight at night

Other than that there is petty theft of unatended belonging, but it's not a common problem. Some people have lost laptops, camaras and money by leaving them visible on their car parked alone.

As anywhere on the world when buying drugs or other dark stuff on the street your are putting yourself in two types of dangers. First you can loose your money and belongings, and/ir can be subject to extorsion.

I have a rule, whatever I take on trip might not come back. Including myself. So... enjoy it while it lasts.
