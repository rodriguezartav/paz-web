For our native ancestors music, dancing and singing in rituals where a central part to their survival. From movies and education we have the image of bare naked savages dancing around the fire, giving praise to a pagan God and we are convinced those actions are due to a lack of knowledge, science and intelligence on their part. We think of it as what we were before we became civilized.

Some of those practices still remain these days in the descendants of those native tribes and regular people that find an appeal to it. This appeal may be considered craziness, fashion or a need for attention by others. I discovered something recently about this topic and would like to have an opportunity to share it.

Most people look at taking care of our planet as a scientific or technical endeavor and that’s ok - it definitely is a step up from using science and technology to destroy the planet. But deep down we all know that something is missing, that we won’t be able to solve this problem by throwing mind and money into it - at least I do.

It’s missing the same thing that’s missing from contemporary medicine. There is a whole energetic, sentient or emotional layer to all of us humans and when we become sick this layer is necessary to regain balance or heal. Evidence is present in everyone’s experience - we become ill and our spirit diminishes and this occurs in a dimension that’s not physical. Same dimension we can experience when looking at a dead person in a funeral - looks exactly the same as our loved one - but something that’s not visible is simply not there anymore. We have it ourselves, but we don’t know what it is.

We recover this energetic state even before we feel recovered. The lack of it becomes even more evident when a proper diagnosis is not reached, or the source of our hope and positivity is simply not present and then we must borrow it from friends and family.

We look at the planet as a scientific apparatus, the same way doctors look at our bodies as a scientific apparatus and that’s ok for most people - until it’s you the one that’s being looked at that way and then told your disease is chronic or has no known cure which is becoming ever more common. Basically in the same way a car owner is told his engine is broken is there’s nothing he can do to change that. Which in both cases is a lie - there is always something to be done.

The disconnection with our ability to heal ourselves and the inability of our society to heal us comes from a more critical disconnection. The disconnection from motherhood, from the feminine singularity that’s the source of life.

We, specially males, but some females as well, have become disconnected from the source of life. It’s so typical that is the normal way to live, there has always been groups of people faking and profiting from this connection. The opposite is so rare that those that really live a connection with the source of life are called gurus, spiritual leaders and healers - yet they are typical persons like you and me.

All of us where created inside the woom of our mothers at a time when we where the most vulnerable. It’s a miracle we made it out of there alive and when we did we where received by someone with all the love in the world. We were feed from her breasts, we were put to sleep, hugged, sang to. We were brought to live from nothing, absolutely nothing by a woman, by our mother.

Yet, when we grow up and are strong and able to live by ourselves we forget that, neglect that and walk in this earth as if we owned it, and every thing in it, including other woman and other man. Our instincts drive us to procreate while our society completely misreprents what relationships are for. We fall pray to marketing or the enhancement of our identity by control, power and possession.

Turning not only our backs, but also our hearts against motherhood, forgetting where we come from and failing to honor that in every action and every word that comes from our being. That is the source of the greatest disconnection and if we can’t find that wrong behavior in ourselves then we are in an even deeper level of disconnection with reality.

From this disconnection, disrespect and stupidity grows our disconnection from our true mother, Mother Earth. That one that feeds us, nurshish us, bath us and heal us. Not only when we were babys, but every single day of our lives. No only us humans, but every single living thing in this planet.

If we are unable to recognize the sacredness of motherhood, of the feminine aspect of life that took care of us even before we where babys - which is the only aspect there is - and recognize the sacredness in every woman. Then it’s absolutely impossible that we can even recognize the sacredness of Mother Earth and that is one reason we are out of tune with reality - living in paradise but not feeling it.

It’s also the reason why we can’t even begin to understand why natives would gather to play music, sing and dance to honor life embodied in fire, wind, water and earth.

Because when we are able to touch our hearts and sing, dance or play an instrument while being fully open and aware of the miracle that being alive is and we turn all of our love to the source of that alivens- then we heal both the wrongdoings that we have done to ourselves as well as to all mothers by forgetting about their powerful and very sensitive existence.

And from there, and from nowhere else, can we start dreaming about healing our society by dancing half naked around a fire…
